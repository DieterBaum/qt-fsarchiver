# qt-fsarchiver-terminal
qt-fsarchiver-terminal is required for qt-fsarchiver (https://github.com/dieterbaum/qt-fsarchiver)to work correctly.
qt-fsarchiver: Back up and restore partitions, directories for Debian,Ubuntu, Linux-Mint, Suse and Fedora [http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/qt4-fsarchiver]
qt-fsarchiver can clone and image hard disks too.

Both programs must be installed.

Fran√ßois Dupoux has developed the basic program fsarchiver, Dieter Baum created the GUI and the code to use the GUI.

qt-fsarchiver a program with a graphical interface for easy operation the archiving program fsarchiver.
qt-fsarchiver has been split into a program with a graphical user interface (qt-fsarchiver)and a terminal program (qt-fsarchiver-terminal).
The graphical program can be started without root rights.
Thus the startup problems with gksu/gksudo, which is no longer installable, were solved with Wayland and Snap programs.

The source code can be installed on any Debian-based system on Suse and Fedora.
For Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint are deb packages for Suse and Fedora rpm packages are available.

Installing the program from the source files:
To install qt-fsarchiver and qt-fsarchiver-terminal the necessary dependencies for fsarchiver and the qt5 development environment must be installed.
Of Debian based distributions: This is the command:
sudo apt install libzip-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev liblzo2-2 liblzo2-dev libgcrypt11-dev e2fslibs-dev libblkid-dev libattr1-dev build-essential qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default btrfs-tools gdisk sshfs sshpass nmap samba nfs-kernel-server nfs-common smbclient liblz4-dev libzstd1-dev jfsutils xfsprogs sudo 

For some distributions, the /etc/sudoers file must be completed with these lines:
username ALL=(ALL) ALL 
%sudo	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
The username has to be adjusted: for example peter.

Instead of libzst1-dev, libzst-dev is installed in some systems. btrfs-tools has recently been replaced by btrfs-progs. The above command has to be adapted accordingly.
 
The command for Suse: (you must be an administrator su -l) zypper in zypper in qt5-default libQt5Core5 libqt5-qttools libqt5-qtbase-devel make libzip-devel libbz2-devel xz-devel lzo-devel libgcrypt-devel e2fsprogs-devel libblkid-devel libattr-devel btrfsprogs gdisk sshfs nmap samba nfs-kernel-server xfsprogs liblz4-1 liblz4-devel libzstd1 libzstd-devel zlib-devel jfsutils 
If you use ssh (secure shell) want to access other computers in the network, you still need to install individually sshpass.

The command for Fedora: (you must be an administrator su -l) dnf install  gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel bzip2-devel xz-devel lzo-devel libgcrypt-devel e2fsprogs-devel libblkid-devel libattr-devel qt5-default qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel gdisk sshfs sshpass nmap samba samba-client nfs-utils beesu lz4-devel libzstd-devel jfsutils xfsprogs
For a 64-bit system, you must also install lrelease: dnf install qt5-linguist.x86-64
32-bit systems are no longer supported.

You change in the terminal to the folder qt-fsarchiver-terminal (extracted from the sources).
This is the command to install the program with Debian, Ubuntu  and und Mint: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake && make && sudo make install
In Debian you must instead sudo make install this: su -l, make install
This is the command for Fedora and Suse: qmake-qt5 && make && sudo make install.

Further information is contained in the doc files of qt-fsarchiver and qt-fsarchiver-terminal.
